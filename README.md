# Estrogens And Cognition

This project analyses data to discern if there is a gene x environment interaction that affects memory in women who have undergone a bilateral salpingo oophorectomy. Specifically, we are looking to see how the body's estrogen levels and Val/Met polymorphisms of the COMT (Val158Met) and BDNF (Val66Met) genes impact memory.
